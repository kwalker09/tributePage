         <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. </blockquote><p>- <em>Bruce Lee</em></p>
